### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ryan!

I'm a Senior Engineer and Lead Engineering Instructor @ Codesmith NYC. I'm experienced in building full-stack JavaScript applications with React, Node, Express, and relational & non-relational databases. I'm also an enthusiastic contributor to the open-source community and co-creator of lexiQL, a GraphQL migration aid and database visualization tool. 

When I'm not managing teams or putting down code, I'm a fan of scuba diving, trying to keep houseplants alive, eating vegan pineapple pizza, birdwatching, and slowly consuming the half-read books piled up on my bedside table.
